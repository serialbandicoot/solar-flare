Machine Learning model for Solar Flare Classification

## Intro
The goal of the ML model is to identify solar flares based on the Enhanced Zurich-McIntosh classification. 

Initially the model will simply classifiy all solar flare activty by grouping or large sunspots. As this model develops it's goal wil be to classify the various groupings. 

See here for an example of the full classification.
